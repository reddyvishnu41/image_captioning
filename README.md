# image_captioning
The goal is advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of
object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex
everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in
precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a
total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via
novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation
